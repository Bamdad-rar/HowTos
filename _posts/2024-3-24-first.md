title: "Exception Handling In Python"

1. Handle exceptions close to where they occure:
	- allows us to catch and address errors quickly without disrupting the flow of our program
	- helps maintain a clear and specific error-handling mechanism

2. Handle them based on your ability to recover
	- if you can recover from a specific exception and continue the program, handle it at an "appropriate level".
	- if the exception is fatal and cannot be recovered, it may be better to let it propagate up the call stack

3. Have more specific exceptions at lower levels for known issues and have broad exception handling at the top level to catch unexpected errors to log and gracefully exit the program

4. avoid catching all exceptions unless necessary
	- `except Exception:` can make it harder to identify and debug issues

5. consider the principle of "Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission" 
	- in python its often more idiomatic to try an operation and catch the exception if it fails, rather than checking beforehand if the operation will succeed.

6. Consider the scope of the exception
	- whether the exception is specific to a particular function or a broader part of your program. if it's specific handle it within that function, if it's more general handle it at a higher level

7. use try-except sparingly
	- using them excessively can obscure the flow of your code.
	only use them if necessary.

8. handle exceptions gracefully
	- by providing helpful error messages
	- for example you can provide context values within the error message, and a helpful message to avoid this error

9. Log the exceptions:
	- #? how to log without try-except and then raising again

10. handle exceptions in a hierarchical manner
	- if you have multiple levels of functions calling each other, start from the innermost function and move outward.
